Features
Authentication

Users can sign up and log in with password hashing.

JWT is used for secure session management.

Role-based access control:

Admin: full access.

Editor: can add and edit only.

Token System

Access Token: short-lived (e.g., 15â€“30 minutes).

Refresh Token: long-lived (e.g., 14 days), stored securely in the database.

Users can request a new access token using the refresh token without logging in again.

Logout invalidates the refresh token in the database.

Password Reset

Users can request a password reset link by email.

A secure token is generated and stored in the database temporarily.

The token expires after a set time (e.g., 30 minutes).

Users can then use the token to set a new password.

Product Management

Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, restore).

Products include name, description, price, category, and image.

Category Management

CRUD operations for categories.

Each category has a name and description.

Environment Setup

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=itask

JWT_SECRET=your_access_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
